# LA Crime Data Analysis (2020–Present)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes the Los Angeles Crime Dataset (2020–Present).  
The focus is on **data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis** to understand crime patterns and prepare the dataset for further modeling.

## ⚙️ Features
- Loaded and inspected large-scale LA crime data using **pandas**.
- Performed **data cleaning**:
  - Removed irrelevant columns.
  - Handled missing values and incorrect datatypes.
  - Converted date fields to proper datetime objects.
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**:
  - Inspected dataset dimensions, columns, and datatypes.
  - Sorted and filtered records for meaningful insights.
- Created **visualizations** with matplotlib to identify trends.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **pandas** – data manipulation
- **matplotlib** – visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: [Crime Data from 2020 to Present (Los Angeles)](https://data.lacity.org/)

📊 Results

Dataset successfully cleaned and preprocessed for further analysis or modeling.

Exploratory insights into crime trends in Los Angeles (from 2020 onwards).

🔮 Future Scope

Perform advanced visualizations (heatmaps, geospatial mapping).

Build predictive models for crime type forecasting.

Deploy results into an interactive dashboard (Streamlit/Plotly).
